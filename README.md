# Python_boat_data

This is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle. It is unknown whether this is real or fictional data. The 
context for it is a website for people to list and sell their yacht/boat. The marketing team for the 
company is looking to analyze data on to inform a weekly newsletter for the boat owners to help them 
increase views on the website to sell their boat. The data is collected over a week timespan since it 
includes a variable for the number of views received in the last seven days. This data is mostly 
trustworthy since it is being sourced from a website which can measure the number of clicks within a 
certain timespan. There is room for error or bias in terms of the boat type, manufacturer, 
measurements, etc. due to the owner inputting this data into the boatâ€™s profile. There are 9889 rows and 
10 columns.
