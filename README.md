# Python_boat_data

This is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle. It is unknown whether this is real or fictional data. The 
context for it is a website for people to list and sell their yacht/boat. The marketing team for the 
company is looking to analyze data on to inform a weekly newsletter for the boat owners to help them 
increase views on the website to sell their boat. The data is collected over a week timespan since it 
includes a variable for the number of views received in the last seven days. This data is mostly 
trustworthy since it is being sourced from a website which can measure the number of clicks within a 
certain timespan. There is room for error or bias in terms of the boat type, manufacturer, 
measurements, etc. due to the owner inpuƫng this data into the boat’s profile. There are 9889 rows and 
10 columns.
